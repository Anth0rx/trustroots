## Volunteering

[developers.trustroots.org](http://developers.trustroots.org/)

You don't have the be a programmer to participate. Check [volunteers page](https://www.trustroots.org/volunteering) for more info.


## Development

Check [developers.trustroots.org](http://developers.trustroots.org/) to get started.


## Installing

We have two major ways of running the software:


### Installing locally

Install the stack on your localhost and run NodeJS. This approach takes a little more time to setup, and bit more manual configuration, but is super fast, and can be easier to work with. See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.


### Installing with Docker

If you are familiar with Docker this is the easiest and quickest way to get started. See [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/blob/master/INSTALL-DOCKER.md) for further details. Running through Docker can be a little bit slower.


## Test framework

Try `npm test`.



## GitHub

We use GitHub for code management and issue tracking. Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/new) there if you run into an issue setting up the system.

The `master` branch is bleeding edge development. `production` is what's running on our servers.


## Developer communication

You can find us on Slack.  If that's too proprietary feel free to contact [Kasper](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/guaka) (kasper at trustroots dot org) or  [Mikael](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/mikael). You can also contact us for an invite without queuing.

It's also great if you join the [hacker tribe](https://www.trustroots.org/tribes).
